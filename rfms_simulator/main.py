The Path Planning algorithms for the World Grid Module!

You can run this module using the command line:

$ python3 -m memory_profiler main.py

The program will popups, and you can run your Path Planning tests.

After you closes the PyGame Screen the memory usage will be shown
at the terminal. For more informations about the memory profiler
package go to:

https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/
